## Computational Thinking - Project Assignment: Sudoku (group assignment)
Project 1 was an individual assignment. It's main goal was to find a new way to digitalize the International Students Guide Amsterdam(ISGA.) Based on a target group analysis. I chose to display the timeline chapters as the main feature of the digital ISGA. The timeline feature uses a JavaScript clock which fetches data from the Firebase database corresponding the current time. All the code had to be hand written, including all logic that runs in the background.

#### Main features:
* Backtrack bruteforce algorithm
* Responsive design
* ES6
* React.js

#### My final grade:
* Paper: To be graded
* Presentation: To be graded
* Code: To be graded
