For the project assignment of Computational Thinking we had to devise a algorithm to would solve 50 given Sudoku's and calclualte the sum of the first 3 digets in the top rigth corner. We also diceded to implement the algorithm, to get an idea of how it would work on the web. The site is and algorithm are written in ES6 JavaScript, with Facebook's famous React.js libary. The user interface also implemnts best practices form the Google Material Design guidelines.

#### Main features:
* Backtrack bruteforce algorithm
* Responsive design
* ES6
* React.js

#### My final grade:
* Paper: To be graded
* Presentation: To be graded
